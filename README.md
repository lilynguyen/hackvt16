# Hack VT 2016

HackVT is a Vermont hackathon open to all age groups in the area ranging from high school students to field professionals. This 24 hour event is hosted at Green Mountain Power's new "Inspire Space" area where all participants gather and collaborate in groups to create the next best app! This year's theme is **EDUCATION**! 

## Description

This project focuses on displaying performance levels of school districts in Vermont and creating correlations to categories and resources i.e. districts with low performing students also have a poor student/teacher ratio, etc. With this display of information we hope to provide resources and suggestions based on studies and teaching methods in order to improve on these results. We hope to visual information from various data sets in a way that it is clear to the consumer that there are areas that directly affect student performance and that could be improved on in the community. All data will be compared to the state average, and the consumer also has the option to compare results directly to other school districts.
